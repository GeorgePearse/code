**Code** is a fast, local coding agent for your terminal. It's a community-driven fork of `openai/codex` focused on real developer ergonomics: Browser integration, multi-agents, theming, and reasoning control ‚Äî all while staying compatible with upstream.

&ensp;
## What's new in v0.4.0 (October 26, 2025)

- **Auto Drive upgraded** ‚Äì hand `/auto` a task and it now plans, coordinates agents, reruns checks, and recovers from hiccups without babysitting.
- **Unified settings** ‚Äì `/settings` centralizes limits, model routing, themes, and CLI integrations so you can audit configuration in one place.
- **Card-based activity** ‚Äì Agents, browser sessions, web search, and Auto Drive render as compact cards with drill-down overlays for full logs.
- **Turbocharged performance** ‚Äì History rendering and streaming were optimized to stay smooth even during long multi-agent sessions.
- **Smarter agents** ‚Äì Mix and match orchestrator CLIs (Claude, Gemini, GPT-5, Qwen, and more) per `/plan`, `/code`, or `/solve` run.

Read the full notes in `release-notes/RELEASE_NOTES.md`.

## Why kode

- üöÄ **Auto Drive orchestration** ‚Äì Multi-agent automation that now self-heals and ships complete tasks.
- üåê **Browser Integration** ‚Äì CDP support, headless browsing, screenshots captured inline.
- ü§ñ **Multi-agent commands** ‚Äì `/plan`, `/code` and `/solve` coordinate multiple CLI agents.
- üß≠ **Unified settings hub** ‚Äì `/settings` overlay for limits, theming, approvals, and provider wiring.

## Quickstart

### Run

```bash
npx -y @just-every/code
```

### Install & Run

```bash
npm install -g @just-every/code
code // or `coder` if you're using VS Code
```

Note: If another tool already provides a `code` command (e.g. VS Code), our CLI is also installed as `coder`. Use `coder` to avoid conflicts.

**Authenticate** (one of the following):
- **Sign in with ChatGPT** (Plus/Pro/Team; uses models available to your plan)
  - Run `code` and pick "Sign in with ChatGPT"
- **API key** (usage-based)
  - Set `export OPENAI_API_KEY=xyz` and run `code`

### Install Claude & Gemini (optional)

Code supports orchestrating other AI CLI tools. Install these and config to use alongside Code.

```bash
# Ensure Node.js 20+ is available locally (installs into ~/.n)
npm install -g n
export N_PREFIX="$HOME/.n"
export PATH="$N_PREFIX/bin:$PATH"
n 20.18.1

# Install the companion CLIs
export npm_config_prefix="${npm_config_prefix:-$HOME/.npm-global}"
mkdir -p "$npm_config_prefix/bin"
export PATH="$npm_config_prefix/bin:$PATH"
npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code @google/gemini-cli @qwen-code/qwen-code

# Quick smoke tests
claude --version
gemini --version
qwen --version
```

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è Add `export N_PREFIX="$HOME/.n"` and `export PATH="$N_PREFIX/bin:$PATH"` (plus the `npm_config_prefix` bin path) to your shell profile so the CLIs stay on `PATH` in future sessions.

## Commands

### Browser
```bash
# Connect code to external Chrome browser (running CDP)
/chrome        # Connect with auto-detect port
/chrome 9222   # Connect to specific port

# Switch to internal browser mode
/browser       # Use internal headless browser
/browser https://example.com  # Open URL in internal browser
```

### Agents
```bash
# Plan code changes (Claude, Gemini and GPT-5 consensus)
# All agents review task and create a consolidated plan
/plan "Stop the AI from ordering pizza at 3AM"

# Solve complex problems (Claude, Gemini and GPT-5 race)
# Fastest preferred (see https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17813)
/solve "Why does deleting one user drop the whole database?"

# Write code! (Claude, Gemini and GPT-5 consensus)
# Creates multiple worktrees then implements the optimal solution
/code "Show dark mode when I feel cranky"
```

### Auto Drive
```bash
# Hand off a multi-step task; Auto Drive will coordinate agents and approvals
/auto "Refactor the auth flow and add device login"

# Resume or inspect an active Auto Drive run
/auto status
```

### General
```bash
# Try a new theme!
/themes

# Change reasoning level
/reasoning low|medium|high

# Switch models or effort presets
/model

# Start new conversation
/new
```

## CLI reference

```shell
code [options] [prompt]

Options:
  --model <name>        Override the model (gpt-5, claude-opus, etc.)
  --read-only          Prevent file modifications
  --no-approval        Skip approval prompts (use with caution)

  --debug             Log API requests and responses to file
  --version           Show version number
```

&ensp;
## Memory & project docs

Code can remember context across sessions:

1. **Create an `AGENTS.md` or `CLAUDE.md` file** in your project root:
```markdown
# Project Context
This is a React TypeScript application with:
- Authentication via JWT
- PostgreSQL database
- Express.js backend

## Key files:
- `/src/auth/` - Authentication logic
- `/src/api/` - API client code
- `/server/` - Backend services
```

2. **Session memory**: Code maintains conversation history
3. **Codebase analysis**: Automatically understands project structure

&ensp;
## Non-interactive / CI mode

For automation and CI/CD:

```shell
# Run a specific task
code --no-approval "run tests and fix any failures"

# Generate reports
code --read-only "analyze code quality and generate report"

# Batch processing
code --config output_format=json "list all TODO comments"
```

&ensp;
## Model Context Protocol (MCP)

Code supports MCP for extended capabilities:

- **File operations**: Advanced file system access
- **Database connections**: Query and modify databases
- **API integrations**: Connect to external services
- **Custom tools**: Build your own extensions

Configure MCP in `~/.code/config.toml` Define each server under a named table like `[mcp_servers.<name>]` (this maps to the JSON `mcpServers` object used by other clients):

```toml
[mcp_servers.filesystem]
command = "npx"
args = ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem", "/path/to/project"]
```

&ensp;
## Configuration

Main config file: `~/.code/config.toml`

> [!NOTE]
> Code reads from both `~/.code/` and `~/.codex/` for backwards compatibility, but it only writes updates to `~/.code/`. If you switch back to Codex and it fails to start, remove `~/.codex/config.toml`. If Code appears to miss settings after upgrading, copy your legacy `~/.codex/config.toml` into `~/.code/`.

```toml
# Model settings
model = "gpt-5"
model_provider = "openai"

# Behavior
approval_policy = "on-request"  # untrusted | on-failure | on-request | never
model_reasoning_effort = "medium" # low | medium | high
sandbox_mode = "workspace-write"

# UI preferences see THEME_CONFIG.md
[tui.theme]
name = "light-photon"

# Add config for specific models
[profiles.gpt-5]
model = "gpt-5"
model_provider = "openai"
approval_policy = "never"
model_reasoning_effort = "high"
model_reasoning_summary = "detailed"
```

### Environment variables

- `CODE_HOME`: Override config directory location
- `OPENAI_API_KEY`: Use API key instead of ChatGPT auth
- `OPENAI_BASE_URL`: Use alternative API endpoints
- `OPENAI_WIRE_API`: Force the built-in OpenAI provider to use `chat` or `responses` wiring

## FAQ

**How is this different from the original?**
> This fork adds browser integration, multi-agent commands (`/plan`, `/solve`, `/code`), theme system, and enhanced reasoning controls while maintaining full compatibility.

**Can I use my existing Codex configuration?**
> Yes. Code reads from both `~/.code/` (primary) and legacy `~/.codex/` directories. We only write to `~/.code/`, so Codex will keep running if you switch back; copy or remove legacy files if you notice conflicts.

**Does this work with ChatGPT Plus?**
> Absolutely. Use the same "Sign in with ChatGPT" flow as the original.

**Is my data secure?**
> Yes. Authentication stays on your machine, and we don't proxy your credentials or conversations.
